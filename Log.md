100 Days Of ML Challenge

Main Commitment

I will code or study Machine Learning for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.

Start Date

August 3th, 2018.

Day 0. Seting up things.

Todays progress:

Done:
Challenge from Learn Python for Data Science #1 by Siraj.
Added to demo.py 3 more classifiers (SVM, Logistic Regression and kNN)

Link https://github.com/OleksiiTarasenko/100DaysOfML/blob/master/LPDS/project1-Male_or_Female.py  
                   
Thoughts -  So far so good. Need more data in demo.py(will find csv file, parse it, train model again)  

Day 1. 

Todays progress:

Done:
Challenge from Learn Python for Data Science #2 by Siraj.
Tweet with labels are written into csv file
Improved data set in project #1

Thoughts - need to refresh knowledge of pandas

Day 2.

Todays progress:

Done: 
Challenge from Learn Python for Data Science #3 by Siraj.
Used 4  models with different loss functions. Printed only best result

Thoughts:

 Got troubles installing lightfm. Helped -> conda install -c conda-forge lightfm
 TODO - Task 1. Create own parser for data base.

 Day 3
